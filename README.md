<p>Employing the CRISP-DM process model, act as a consultant for the Portuguese NTBO. My job is to characterize and describe the patterns of visitants of Portuguese attractions and comparing it to Portugal's main tourism competitors. In addition, I will try to understand visitors' frequent itemset associations, similarities between attractions and visitors.</p>
