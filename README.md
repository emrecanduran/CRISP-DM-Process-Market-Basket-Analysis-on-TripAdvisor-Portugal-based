## CRISP-DM-Process-Market-Basket-Analysis-on-TripAdvisor


### Project Overview 

<p>Tourism was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. National Tourism Board Organizations (NTBO) want to study users' generated content, such as Social Media reviews, to understand visitors patterns and if these patterns were affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Employing the CRISP-DM process model, act as a consultant for the Portuguese NTBO. My job is to characterize and describe the patterns of visitants of Portuguese attractions and comparing it to Portugal's main tourism competitors. In addition, I will try to understand visitors' frequent itemset associations, similarities between attractions and visitors.</p> 

### CRISP DM Process Model

CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is a widely used and well-established data mining process model that provides a structured approach for planning, executing, and managing data mining projects. The CRISP-DM process consists of six phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, Deployment. 

Here is an example : [Business & Data Understanding](https://github.com/emrecanduran/CRISP-DM-Process-Market-Basket-Analysis-on-TripAdvisor-Portugal-based/blob/90396b87c443d752d5f7b1560f43d5b398d43ed0/Business%20&%20Data%20Understanding.ipynb)


### Action 

As a master's degree student, I was tasked with making a final project with a detailed report for Data Science for Marketing course. 

### Setup

This project has been implemented on jupyter notebook using a main and an auxiliary dataset. 

### Method 

The steps were taken in accordance with the CRISP DM methodology, the data sets were examined and interesting patterns were tried to be found. The Apriori algorithm(Frequent Itemsets - Association Rule Mining) was used as the model.
